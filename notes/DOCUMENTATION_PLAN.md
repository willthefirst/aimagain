# 📚 Aimagain codebase documentation plan

## 🎯 Objective: LLM-optimized documentation at every level

Apply the established **"LLM-Optimized Documentation"** standards from `tests/test_contract/README.md` systematically across the entire codebase to make it interpretable by both developers and LLM agents.

## 📋 Documentation standards checklist

Each README must include:

- **🎯 Philosophy/Purpose**: Why this module/approach exists
- **🏗️ Implementation patterns**: How to use/extend the code
- **✅ What we do** vs **❌ What we don't do** boundaries
- **📁 Directory structure** with explanations
- **🔧 Quick reference**: Commands, patterns, configuration
- **🚨 Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions
- **📝 Examples**: Complete, runnable code examples

## 🗂️ priority order for documentation creation

### Phase 1: Core application architecture (HIGH PRIORITY)

1. **`src/README.md`** ✅ - Main application architecture overview
2. **`src/api/README.md`** ✅ - API layer design and patterns
3. **`src/services/README.md`** ✅ - Business logic organization
4. **`src/models/README.md`** ✅ - Data model design principles
5. **`src/repositories/README.md`** ✅ - Data access patterns
6. **`tests/README.md`** ✅ - Testing strategy and organization

### Phase 2: Specialized documentation (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

7. **`src/api/routes/README.md`** ✅ - Route organization and patterns
8. **`src/api/common/README.md`** ✅ - Shared API utilities
9. **`src/schemas/README.md`** ✅ - Request/response schemas
10. **`src/middleware/README.md`** ✅ - Middleware patterns
11. **`src/logic/README.md`** - Processing logic organization
12. **`src/templates/README.md`** - Template structure and patterns

### Phase 3: Supporting documentation (LOW PRIORITY)

13. **`notes/README.md`** - Development notes organization
14. **`src/core/README.md`** - Core configuration and utilities
15. **`alembic/README.md`** - Database migration processes
16. **Root `README.md`** - Expand with full project overview

## 📐 Template structure for each readme

Based on the excellent `tests/test_contract/README.md` pattern:

```markdown
# [Module name]: [brief description]

[One-paragraph explanation of the module's purpose and role in the application]

## 🎯 Core philosophy: [key concept]

### [What we do] ✅

- **[Key responsibility 1]**: [Explanation with example]
- **[Key responsibility 2]**: [Explanation with example]

**Example**: [Concrete code example]

### [What we don't do] ❌

- **[Non-responsibility 1]**: [Explanation of what belongs elsewhere]
- **[Non-responsibility 2]**: [Explanation of what belongs elsewhere]

**Example**: [What NOT to put here and where it should go instead]

## 🏗️ Architecture: [Key architectural pattern]

[Explanation of how this module fits into the larger architecture]

### [Subsection 1]

[Code example with explanation]

### [Subsection 2]

[Code example with explanation]

## 📋 [Responsibility matrix/Quick reference]

[Table or list of key patterns, commands, or responsibilities]

## 📁 Directory structure
```

module/
├── file1.py # Purpose and responsibility
├── file2.py # Purpose and responsibility
└── subdir/ # Purpose and contents
└── file3.py # Purpose and responsibility

```

## 🔧 Implementation patterns

### [Pattern 1 name]
[Description and code example]

### [Pattern 2 name]
[Description and code example]

## 🚨 Common issues and solutions

### [Issue 1]
**Problem**: [Description]
**Solution**: [Code example or explanation]

### [Issue 2]
**Problem**: [Description]
**Solution**: [Code example or explanation]

## 📚 Related documentation

- [Link to related internal docs]
- [Link to related internal docs]
```

## 🔄 Implementation strategy

### Step 1: Start with `src/README.md`

- Create the main application architecture overview
- This becomes the "north star" for all other documentation

### Step 2: Work outward by importance

- Document the most critical paths first (API, services, models)
- Each README should link to related READMEs

### Step 3: Cross-reference and iterate

- Ensure all READMEs link to each other appropriately
- Update examples to be consistent across all documentation

### Step 4: Validate with LLM

- Test that an LLM can understand the codebase structure from the documentation alone
- Refine based on any gaps or confusion

## 🎯 Success criteria

### For developers:

- New team member can understand any module's purpose in < 5 minutes
- Clear guidance on where to add new functionality
- Troubleshooting guides prevent common mistakes

### For LLM agents:

- Can understand the codebase architecture from documentation alone
- Can make appropriate suggestions for where to add new features
- Can identify the correct patterns and boundaries for changes

## 📊 Documentation quality metrics

### Each readme should answer:

- **What**: What does this module do?
- **Why**: Why does it exist and why this approach?
- **How**: How to use/extend it with concrete examples?
- **Where**: Where does it fit in the larger architecture?
- **When**: When to use vs not use patterns in this module?

### LLM optimization checklist:

- [ ] Visual hierarchy with emoji anchors
- [ ] Clear "do/don't do" boundaries
- [ ] Concrete code examples (not abstract descriptions)
- [ ] Directory structure with explanations
- [ ] Cross-references to related modules
- [ ] Quick reference tables/lists
- [ ] Troubleshooting section
- [ ] Implementation patterns with step-by-step guides

## 🚀 Next steps

1. **Create `src/README.md`** as the foundational architecture document
2. **Follow with `src/api/README.md`** to establish API patterns
3. **Continue through the priority list** systematically
4. **Update this plan** as we discover new documentation needs
5. **Maintain cross-references** between all documentation files

**Remember**: This documentation is infrastructure. It should be maintained with the same rigor as the code itself, following the established workspace rules for proactive README maintenance.
