"""Seed orchestrator — walks `metadata.sorted_tables` in FK-safe order
and, per table, either runs a registered override or generates rows
generically via `build_row`.

Two design moves keep "adding a model" cheap:

  1. **FK-safe ordering is derived, not declared.** SQLAlchemy already
     knows the topological order from FK declarations; we just walk it.
     Adding a model means SQLAlchemy puts it in the right place — no
     edit here.

  2. **Generic-by-default, override-by-exception.** A model with no
     entry in `overrides.OVERRIDES` falls through to introspection-
     driven `build_row` for `GENERIC_COUNTS.get(table, DEFAULT)` rows.
     Adding a normal model is zero edits anywhere (besides the model
     file itself).

Tables the runner *deliberately* skips:
  - `audit_log` — framework-owned; AuditLog appends rows in response to
    other writes, so seeding it directly would be redundant and would
    fight the trigger semantics.

Tables added in the future that need a row count: add an entry to
`counts.GENERIC_COUNTS`. The runner default is intentionally small
(`DEFAULT_GENERIC_COUNT`) so unknown tables don't explode the seed.
