"""Per-model structural overrides.

The generic introspection-driven generator in `../generators.py` covers
single-row-from-columns shapes. This package owns the cases that need
something more:

  - Cross-row construction (Post + matching kind-detail).
  - Constructor side effects (Provider auto-creates Clinician + Affiliation).
  - Fan-out counts that depend on other rows (1-3 credentials per clinician).
  - Hierarchical structure (parent/child Organizations).
  - Special creation paths (User → fastapi-users password hashing).
  - M:N dedup (UserFavorite).

Adding a new model: if the generic generator handles it, you do
nothing here. Add an override only when the model needs something the
generic path can't reasonably introspect.
