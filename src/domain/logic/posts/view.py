"""View helpers for posts — pure functions consumed by templates.

The listing row in `src/domain/templates/posts/_item.html` needs a single
4-state "insurance posture" axis to render as one icon badge. The two
kinds model the underlying data with parallel shapes:

  * `referral` — two independent payment-path booleans
    (`accepts_in_network` / `accepts_private_pay`) plus an
    `insurance_carriers` JSON list of `INSURANCE_CARRIERS` tokens.
    The posture is derived from the booleans in priority order:
    in-network → private-pay → please_contact (none set).
  * `opening` → linked `ClinicianAffiliation` — the
    `in_network_carriers` list (empty = no in-network) plus the
    `accepts_out_of_network` / `sliding_scale` booleans.

`insurance_posture_for_post(post)` collapses both shapes to a value
from `INSURANCE_POSTURES` (see `src/domain/models/enums.py`). The
ordering of branches is the priority the row should show: if a
clinician accepts in-network plans, that's the posture, even if they
also offer sliding scale — the in-network signal is louder.

`referral_headline(detail)` composes the CR card's headline text from
`age_groups[0]` — e.g. "Adult (25–64)". CR posts describe one client,
so the first age group is the client's age (the schema still allows
multi for forward-compat but only the first drives the title).

`post_card_view(post)` is the unified view-model that both the listing
card (`_item.html`) and the detail page (`detail.html`) read from. Each
kind's underlying detail relationship has a different field set and
naming — CR holds its own (city, state, zip) location; PA reads
location and insurance from the linked ClinicianAffiliation (the
practice the opening announces, NOT the clinician's primary-affiliation
proxies — a multi-affiliation clinician's opening must show the
posting practice's facts); program reads identity from the linked
Program. The function collapses those three shapes into one flat dict
so templates iterate over keys rather than branching on `post.kind`.
Values that don't apply to a kind are ``None`` (or empty lists);
templates render via ``{% if view.x %}``. Raw enum values are returned
— display-label lookup is the template's job (it's the same label dict
pattern as elsewhere).

The opening and intake branches additionally consult the linked
``ClinicianAffiliation`` (and the linked ``Clinician`` for the
person-level ``languages``) — for openings — or the linked
``Program`` — for intakes — when reading the steady-state profile
fields (`services` / `settings` / `modalities` / `age_groups` /
`genders` / `website` / `referral_instructions` / `languages`). These
fields moved off the per-announcement detail row to their steady-state
homes in #1358 PR-f; sub-3 dropped the detail-row columns, so reads
come exclusively from the new home.

`post_feed_headline(post)` builds the two-part headline for the
feed-row component used in the home and browse list views. Format is
``"<identity> — <clinical focus>"``: demographics + services for
referrals, practice name + services/settings for openings.

All helpers are exposed as Jinja globals by
`src/framework/rendering/templating.py`.

    Returns:
        kind: the discriminator (`referral` /
            `opening` / `intake`).
        kind_verb: ``"Seeking"`` for CR, ``"Providing"`` for the two
            availability kinds. Mirrors the kind-chip vocabulary the
            list card's left-edge color uses (orange = Seeking, cyan
            = Providing).
        headline: the card's identity line — CR is ``referral_headline``
            (age only after the gender column was removed); PA is the
            practice's org name; program is the program name.
        header_state: the state shown next to the headline. Program
            reads from ``program.state_preference``; CR and PA leave
            this ``None`` and surface their state via the
            demographics-column ``location_chunk`` row instead — that
            keeps the header line uncluttered and makes the two
            availability-vs-seeker kinds consistent on where location
            appears in the card.
        in_person / virtual: the post's in-person/virtual posture as
            `LOCATION_AVAILABILITY_OPTIONS` values. CR reads them off
            its own detail row; PA reads them from the linked
            ClinicianAffiliation's session-availability fields. Program
            has no in-person/virtual posture and returns ``None`` for
            both.
        services / settings: raw enum lists. PA + program carry
            ``settings``; CR's ``settings`` is empty.
        ages / languages / genders: raw enum lists. CR has no
            ``genders`` slot (the column was removed); opening/intake
            fill ``genders`` from the linked affiliation / program.
        insurance_posture: one of ``INSURANCE_POSTURES`` or ``None``
            (intake has no posture). Same value
            ``insurance_posture_for_post`` returns.
        treatment_modality: free-text modality string or ``None``.
        location_chunk: ``{city, state, zip}`` for CR (from the
            detail row) and PA (from the linked ClinicianAffiliation) —
            the demographics-column icon-only row both render. ``None``
            for program (no location of its own; ``state_preference``
            still surfaces via ``header_state``).
        description: free-text description or ``None``. CR's
            description is NOT NULL on the model but the function
            stays defensive for stubs that omit it.
        schedule_text: PA/program optional schedule notes; ``None``
            for CR.
        provider_ref: the canonical "who's behind this post" reference —
            ``{name, entity, id, org}`` where ``entity`` is ``"clinician"``
            (opening, referral) or ``"program"`` (intake), ``id`` is that
            entity's id (``None`` when unlinkable — e.g. a legacy referral
            whose ``referring_clinician_id`` was never set), and ``org`` is
            ``{id, name}`` of the owning Organization or ``None`` (a
            sole-proprietor clinician has no org). The ``provider_ref``
            macro renders this as the hyperlinked "<name> · <org>"
            denotation on the detail card and the feed byline — one home
            for the format and the links across surfaces. For a referral
            the entity is the referring clinician (FK
            ``referral_detail.referring_clinician_id``) and the org comes
            from the affiliation the clinician is referring under
            (``referral_detail.clinician_affiliation``); pre-#1454 rows
            with no ``referring_clinician_id`` fall back to the post
            owner's first clinician as a name-only reference.
        practice_link: ``{id, name}`` — the linked Clinician's id with
            the affiliation's org name; ``None`` for other kinds.
        program_link: ``{id, name}`` of program's linked Program;
            ``None`` for other kinds.
        organization_link: ``{id, name}`` of the post's owning
            Organization (PA reads through ``clinician_affiliation.org``;
            program intake reads through ``program.organization``).
            ``None`` for referral (CR has no org linkage in the model).
            The owner-context card renders this as a clickable link so
            any post is one click from its org's detail page.
        full_address: ``"City, ST ZIP"`` string for the detail page's
            expanded location row — the post-own address. CR reads from
            its own client-location columns; PA reads from the linked
            ClinicianAffiliation; program returns ``None``.
        owner_address: ``"City, ST ZIP"`` string for the owner-context
            card's Address row — the provider-side address. PA's owner
            is the linked ClinicianAffiliation (same string as
            ``full_address``); referral's owner is the affiliation the
            referring clinician acts under
            (``referral_detail.clinician_affiliation``, distinct from the
            client location in ``full_address``); program returns
            ``None`` (programs have no address).
        accepts_in_network / accepts_private_pay: CR-only payment-path
            booleans from the detail row; ``None`` for other kinds.
        insurance_carriers: CR-only list of carrier tokens; empty list
            for CR with no carriers specified, ``[]`` for other kinds.
        in_network_carriers / accepts_out_of_network / sliding_scale:
            PA-only raw values from the linked ClinicianAffiliation,
            consumed by the feed-row meta strip (``_feed_row.html``).
            ``in_network_carriers`` comes back as an empty list when
            unset; the other two are ``None`` for other kinds.

    PA ``cost`` and the "how to refer" pair (website, referral
    instructions) are NOT view-model keys — the detail page's
    owner-context card renders them straight off the linked
    ``ClinicianAffiliation`` / ``Program`` via the shared
    ``affiliation_facts`` / ``program_facts`` macros.
