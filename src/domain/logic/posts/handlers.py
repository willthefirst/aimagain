"""Per-spec hook callables for the `Post` entity.

`_assert_post_payload_authz` is the entry point driven by
``POST_ENTITY.payload_authz_path``: it layers FK-ownership (the
submitter must own the cross-entity row the post references) AND the
capability gate from the two-claim verification model (a referral / a
clinician-opening requires Claim A; a program-intake requires Claim B
for the org behind the referenced Program).

Why it dispatches on ``payload.kind``: all three kinds reference a
cross-entity FK the submitting user must own.
``clinician_opening.clinician_id`` and ``program_intake.program_id``
point at rows the user created; ``referral.referring_clinician_id``
points at a Clinician the user owns. The cleaner long-term shape is
per-kind authz on :class:`PostKindSpec`; a type-switching dispatcher is
acceptable while the kind set is small.

    create payload via one of two authority paths.

    First ``_resolve_affiliation_context`` derives the listing's
    clinician FK from the picker-submitted ``clinician_affiliation_id``
    (clinician-authored kinds only) and returns the resolved
    affiliation. Authority then resolves as:

    1. **Org-rep (Claim B) path** — if the payload carries an
       affiliation and the requesting user is a *verified org rep*
       (`capabilities.org_rep_verified`) for that affiliation's org,
       the write is authorized. This lets a group-practice coordinator
       post a referral/opening under an affiliated clinician they don't
       *own*, without holding Claim A themselves — the org-rep authority
       chain (`OrgRepresentation` → org → affiliation → clinician).

    2. **Self (owner + Claim A) path** — otherwise the per-kind FK on
       the payload must point at a row the requesting user owns
       (:func:`_assert_post_payload_target_ownership`) AND the user must
       hold the claim that gates this post-kind
       (:func:`_assert_post_payload_capability`):

       - ``referral`` / ``clinician_opening`` → Claim A
         (`capabilities.clinician_verified(user)`).
       - ``program_intake`` → Claim B for the referenced Program's org
         (deferred — the org lookup lands when the Profile Hub PR
         (Phase 5) wires the program-intake create flow end-to-end).

    Superusers fall through to the self path, where both the ownership
    and capability checks bypass for admins — so an admin still writes
    any row. ``program_intake`` carries no affiliation, so it always
    takes the self path (its org authority is the Program's owning org,
    handled there).

    **Create-only.** The org-rep path is wired on create
    (`mount_create` runs only ``payload_authz`` on the not-yet-existing
    post). Editing a post one doesn't own is still gated by the
    object-level ``write_authz`` (owner-or-admin) that runs before this
    hook on PATCH — expanding *that* to the org-rep chain needs an async
    object-level policy and is a separate change.
