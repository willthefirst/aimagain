"""URL invariants for the unified `/posts` whole-supertype face.

`Post` is a polymorphic supertype with three kinds (`referral`,
`clinician_opening`, `program_intake`) exposed under a single URL
family. This module pins the cross-kind invariants the framework's
whole-supertype dispatch buys us:

  - the list / search / form-picker routes respond 200;
  - `/posts/form` (no `?kind=`) renders the picker; `/posts/form?kind=X`
    renders the kind-specific create form;
  - the `kind` filter is exposed on `/posts/search` so a viewer can
    narrow the unified feed to one kind;
  - `?kind=<value>` on the list URL narrows results to that kind;
  - owner authz invariants survive the consolidation (non-owner can't
    patch/delete; admin can);
  - the `form_error_render` opt-in is wired end-to-end for each kind.

Per-kind detail-rendering assertions (which DOM elements a referral
card surfaces vs. an opening card vs. an intake card) are the long
tail and live in the kind-specific template / card-view tests.
