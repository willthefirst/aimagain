"""Controlled-vocabulary `LabeledChoice` classes; derived tuple/dict aliases.

Every labeled vocabulary is a `LabeledChoice` subclass (see `labeled_choice.py`):
the class declares value + label + optional icon per member, and the historical
`FOO` / `FOO_LABELS` / `FOO_ICONS` names are kept as derived aliases
(`Cls.values()` / `.labels()` / `.icons()`) so every downstream consumer stays
unchanged. Vocabularies whose display facts are richer than value+label+icon
(`ClientAgeGroup`, `DesiredTimeDay`) subclass with a custom `__new__` that
attaches the extra attributes; their derived dicts read those off the members.

`US_STATES` is the one plain tuple left: the value (USPS abbreviation) is its
own user-facing label, so there's nothing to single-source — one structure, no
parallel dict to drift from.
